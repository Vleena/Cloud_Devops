Inventory File: An Ansible inventory is a text file that lists the managed nodes (servers) where tasks defined in your playbook will be executed. It allows you to group servers (e.g., [webservers]) to target multiple systems at once.
Ansible Playbook Goal: The playbook will automate the installation of the Apache HTTP Server (package name httpd) on RHEL systems and can be configured to deploy a custom index.html file with the message "Welcome to the Ansible Playbook". 
Steps to Execute:-
1:- Install Ansible:
  pip3 install ansible -y
2:- Verify Installation:
  Check the version to ensure it is installed correctly.
  ansible --version
3:- Execute the Playbook:
  Run the ansible-playbook command with root privileges
  ansible-playbook -i Inventory httpd_playbook.yml
4:- Verify Deployment:
  Once the playbook finishes, open a browser and navigate to the server's address to see your message.
